~ I've noticed that when using the bootstrap navbars, I cannot change the text colour,
  it seems to be when I'm using the Bootstrap classes "navbar-light" or "navbar-dark"
  with "bg-light" or "bg-dark". I've only been able to override it with the !important
  css property.  When I looked in developer tools, even though the fonts and other
  stylings were being applied, the colour was not unless I flagged it as important.
~ Using 100vw would create a horizontal scroll bar, but using a width of 100% instead
  seems to work better as a unit of measurement, I'm not sure why.
